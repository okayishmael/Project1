========================================================

Project 1 (Explination on how I did it)<br />

Github<br />
Create  git account<br />
Create a Repository and check initialize readme and save.<br />
On the created repository page, click the <strong>clone or download</strong> button and copy  the link<br />
 

Editor<br />
Open Editor (Mine is Visual Studio)<br />
 In terminal use command git clone + copied link (don't use + just space and paste the link)<br />
 It should look like this:<br /><br />
 PS C:\Users\CodePartnersTestPC\Desktop\Ishmael201\code201> git clone https://github.com/okayishmael/Project1.git
 <br /><br />
 What the about means?
 On your computer, under user (in this case is CodeParnters or Me)<br />
 On the desktop, there is a folder called <strong>ishmael201</stong>. In there,  is another folder called <strong>code201</strong><br />
 clone <stong>https://github.com/okayishmael/Project1.git</stong>(ropository we created on git) into code201 folder.<br /> <br />

create html, css and js files or whatever your project is about<br />
update and save<br />
Create an index.html file which is a must. And in my case, I create a  js that prompt user to give name, origin,  and confirm if there are coder when they first visit the site<br />
Save file<br />




Add files (html, css, js readme) to Repository you create in git via terminal using the following commands<br />

git status (tells you which dirtory/ you're in on your computer)<br />
git add .   (adds files from the specified directory to stage, a half way mark until you commit)<br />
git commit _m "comment of what you did goes here" (its ready to be pushed/post to your repository)<br />
git push origin master (here final post is made with the cmment of what you did on the files you are posting)<br />
Here you might be prompted to login into git (via terminal)<br />
Enter git username and password<br />
There, You're Done (open git in your browser and view the files in repository)<br />
